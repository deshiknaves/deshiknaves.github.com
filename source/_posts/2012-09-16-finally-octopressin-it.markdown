**And so it starts...**

Been meaning to get a blog up so that I could write down some of the things I learn about on a daily basis building applications. I figure that this is one way to document some of the techniques that I figure out - and then then do forget about if it's not a common occourance. This way I can quickly write a little bit about it and have it there for later reference. And it might help out someone who has has the same issue. Eitherway, it's mainly about my journey as a devleoper.

I could spend a bunch of time designing and building a blog, but that's just not needed, it's about the content. With the fact that there is going to be a lot of code references, [Octopress](http://octopress.com) seems to be perfect for my own needs. Not having an admin interface and just bein able to write a blog post from the command line and markdown is just perfect for what I need. I haven't quite checked out all the internal workings of this application yet, but it does seem weird not to have a database to store the data. But this is an awesomely put together blogging framework.

Now to figure out some of the finer details of this blog.
